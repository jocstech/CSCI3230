  <p>MTGMVP[18/04/2014]: This game is great! Since I am a long time Magic:The Gathering player as well as a World of Warcraft player, it is almost too easy to play this game!</p>

  <p>NVRLucky[25/09/2015]: I am having a hard time playing this game! It is too confusing and some of the mechanics seems hard to understand! Is there a tutorial that I can go through??</p>
